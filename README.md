# Superheroes IOS

This is a simple app which should display a list of superheroes and some information about them. It uses the superhero api at superheroapi.com. Some components of the app have ben built but it is incomplete.

1. Run the app - there are multiple problems. Please investigate and make the minimal fixes to make the app run. Hint: you may need an api key from superheroapi.com

2. Looking at the Main View - how can we improve this?

3. Please refactor the code to make the code more testable and maintainable

4. Please add a couple of tests to ensure Superheros are marked correctly as fast (when speed is over 50), strong (when power is over 55) and smart (when intelligence is over 60)

5. We want to mark a superhero as a [Fighter] when combat is over 30. Please add this functionality 

6. Add a text field and button to allow us to search for different superheros

7. Is there anything you would do to improve the design on a production app?

8. How would you handle failures (e.g. API errors)

9. Explain how you would add a details page to this app which shows all power stats for a particular superhero

10. Anything else you would do to make this app production ready?
